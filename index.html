I am a current PhD student at MIT advised by <a href="https://wi.mit.edu/people/member/li">Pulin Li</a>, a member of the Whitehead Institute. I am interested in both natural and synthetic genetic circuits, those that enable diverse behaviors in nature and in the test tube. In particular, I am looking for design principles that may enable us to build more sophisticated circuits for synthetic biology. I use machine and statistical learning techniques to try to infer these principles from the wealth of high-dimensional biological data. I am fortunate to be supported by an MIT Presidential Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before starting my PhD, I was a research associate at Twist Bioscience and received my BS from Caltech.
